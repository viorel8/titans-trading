Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine for all types of data. Often associated with the term **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana).

- **NoSQL database** - can be used as a replacement for document stores like MongoDB.
- **JSON Document** - uses documents as JSON objects stored in an Elasticsearch index, which is the basic unit of storage.
- **Schema-free** - does not require you to specify a schema. Uses JSON and does some guesswork to determine the types.
- **RESTful APIs** - use to configure and query data.
- **Scalable and distributed** - multiple nodes with replicas.

#### What is Elasticsearch used for?
- Search in applications/websites
- Logging and log analysis
- Infrastructure and application metrics and performance monitoring
- Spatial data analysis and visualization
- Security analysis
- Business analytics

#### Demo architecture

![Elastic architecture](./Assets/elastic_architecture_full.png "Elastic architecture")


#### Terms 
- **Docker** - Is a containerization technology and an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. 
- **Beast** - Single-purpose data shipper. 
  - `Metricbeat` - Metrics shipper, collects and ships various system and service metrics.
  - `Filebeat` - Log shipper, preloads and preprocesses log files 
  - `Heartbeat` - Uptime shipper, monitors service uptime
  - `Packetbeat` - Real-time network packet analyzer
- **Logstash** - Processing pipeline that ingests data from various sources, transforms it and stores it in Elastic. 
- **Serilog** - Serilog is a diagnostic logging library for . NET applications
  - `Serilog sink` delivers the data to Elasticsearch (exporter). This is done in a similar structure to *Logstash* and makes it easier to use Kibana to visualize your logs. 
- **Opentelemetry** - Is a collection of tools, APIs and SDKs used to collect telemetry data from distributed systems. 
  - `Opentelemetry Exporter` - Client-side SDK that ensures that data is sent to various systems, in this case the Elastic APM Server. 
- **APM Server** - Application Performance Monitoring System. The APM server receives data from APM agents and converts it into Elasticsearch documents. 
  - `APM Agent` - Client-side SDK for app metrics data to APM Server.
- **Kibana** - Front-end application built on top of Elastic Stack that provides search and data visualization capabilities. 
- **PostgreSQL** - Is an open source object-relational database. 
- **Scheduler** - Is an application that allows you to schedule and track computer batch tasks. 
- **Other Services** - Can be a file server, Redis, message queue, notification service, etc.

#### How does Elasticsearch work?

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Elastic processing" src="./Assets/elasticprocess.png">
</p>


1) **Raw Data** - Data flows into Elasticsearch from a variety of sources, including logs, system metrics, and web applications
2) **Data Entry** - Process by which this raw data is parsed, normalized, and enriched before being indexed in Elasticsearch.
3) **Ready to Query** Once the data is indexed in Elasticsearch, users can run complex queries over their data and use aggregations to get complex summaries of their data.


##### Elasticsearch document

Documents are JSON objects that are stored in an Elasticsearch index. Each document is a key-value pair (names of fields or properties) with their corresponding values.

#### What is an Elasticsearch index?

<!-- ![Elastic index](./Assets/ivertedindex.png "Elastic index") -->

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Elastic inverted index" src="./Assets/ivertedindex.png">

- Is a collection of documents that are related to each other.
- Elasticsearch stores data as JSON documents and creates an [inverted index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) on top of it.
- You can define as many indexes in Elasticsearch as you like.
- Indexes are identified by lowercase names
- Each index consists of one or more shards


Index size is a common cause of Elasticsearch problems. One way to handle this problem is to divide indexes horizontally into parts called **shards**. 

>**NOTE :** The data in Elasticsearch is organized into indexes. Each index is composed of one or more shards. 

In Elasticsearch, each query is executed in a single thread per shard. However, multiple shards can be processed in para

#### What is Kibana?
Kibana allows users to visualize data with charts and graphs in Elasticsearch. 

**Provides:**
- Visualization of data
- Exploration tool
- Time series analysis
- Application monitoring
- Operational Intelligence
- Reporting, etc.

#### What is APM?
Elastic APM is application performance monitoring. It allows you to monitor software services and applications in real time by collecting detailed performance information. **This helps to troubleshoot problems quickly.**

- **APM** collects logs, metrics, and traces.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="APM error debugging" src="./Assets/apm_error_debugging.png">
</p>

##### APM architecture

APM provides [agents for various languages](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/index.html) and support input dirrectly from [opentelemerty protocol](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/get-started/current/open-telemetry-elastic.html) ( includes opnetelemetry collector ).
<p align="center">
  <img alt="APM architecture" src="./Assets/apm_arch.png">
</p>


**Supported inputs are:**
 1) `Elastic protocol` - Elastic communication. 
 2) `Opentelemetry Protocol` - Open standard for telemetry data. 

 **Main advantage** compared to *Jaeger tracing* or *Zipkin* is that APM connects logs, metrics and traces via Elastic Stack and displays everything in one UI. This reduces the number of external applications and simplifies the search and analysis of the observed data.

##### APM Kibana Interface

The Kibana plugin for APM allows you to analyze traces and related logs in an easy and enjoyable way.

## Install in docker enviroment

#### Install options
There are 2 distribution ( licensed opensource and always free opensource)
1) [Official Elastic from 'elastic.co'](https://www.elastic.co/) - Opensource but all premium features like security are licenced.
2) [Opensearch](https://opensearch.org/) - 100% open source, with enterprise security, alerting, SQL, etc.. Previously called `OpenDistro for Elastic` which is now deprecated since *Elastic.co* changed licensing the Amazon created new fork `Opensearch` with big investments and longterm roadmap.

![Kibana record view](./Assets/opensearch.png "Opensearch vs Elasticsearch")
</p>

>**INFO** This demo uses **Standard Elasticsearch** because it has **better** performance analysis tools than *OpenSearch*.

#### Docker compose

`Elastic.co` provides several examples of stack installation (Elastic / Kibana...), but in the end you need to understand each part and be able to create a custom `docker-compose.yml` that fits your needs.

In this example, the following containers are created under the `Elastic` network:
 
- `Elastic nodes` -  1,2 (setup of 2 nodes).
- `Logstash` - Pipeline for log processing
- `Kibana` - Visualization UI
- `APM Server` - Elastic server and collector for performance analysis
- `Opentelemetry collector` - This is only needed if you want to merge traces from different sources through one collector. It is recommended to isolate the zones through it.
    - **APM supports** `otel-protocol` by default and traces can be sent directly without anything going ahead.

> &#10240;
> **WARNING** The example should not be used in real production! For that you need to configure the security plugin and set up at least 4 nodes. This is a recommendation!
> &#10240;

1) Create `docker-compose.yml` [../Src/Docker/ElasticSearch/docker-compose.yml](../Src/Docker/ElasticSearch/docker-compose.yml).

2) Run `docker-compose up`. This will create, (re)create, start and attach containers for a service.

    *Output:*
    ```shell
    Starting es01 ... done
    Starting es02 ... done
    Starting elasticsearch_kibana ... done
    Starting elasticsearch_logstash ... done
    Starting elasticsearch_apm-server ... done
    Starting opentelemetry-collector ... done
    ```

    This will take some time as the services are interdependent (one waiting for another to start). It may take `5-10 minutes`. The wait process is necessary to avoid connection errors between services during startup. Without this process you may get too many error logs. 

    ###### Build Process: 
    1) Elastic Nodes 1,2 are created and started. 
    2) Then composer waits for Elastic to start and be available (helatcheck). 
    3) Composer Builds Kibana and launches it 
    4) Composer Builds Logstash and starts it 
    5) APM server build waits for Kibana and Elastic to be available (helatcheck). 
    6) Composer Builds APM Server and starts it. 
    7) Opentelemetry Collector Build waits until APM Server is available (helatcheck). 
    8) Opentelemetry Collector build and launch.

#### Explore containers
There should be 6 running containers available under your docker. You can use docker UI or the terminal 'docker ps' to see all running containers. Use `docker ps -a` to see all containers (running/non-running).

![Elasticsearch docker images](./Assets/docker_elasticsearch_overview.png "Elasticsearch docker images overview")

Or from the terminal: (`docker ps`)

## First startup

**Default Kibana Url** - `http://localhost:5601/` by default it's `http`

**Default Elastic Url** - `http://localhost:9200/` defaults to `http`

**Elastic Connection string Url** `http://localhost:9200` 

>**WARNING** Demo shows setup without security plugin! (No password and no TLS)

Kibana UI changes a lot over time, so there is no particular reason to repeat the initial showcase, because next month the UI may look different :)

After the initial load, you need to set up an index pattern. Kibana uses it to determine what kind of data you want to visualize.

![Discover index](./Assets/create_index_pattern.PNG "Discover index")

> &#10240;
>If you see some old/previous install data and the index is already set up, there is probably old data from Docker. You can delete the old volumes and find them as a directory under the path:
>
>**Path on WSL:**
>```Shell
>\\wsl$\docker-desktop-data\version-pack-data\community\docker\volumes
>```
>**Path on Linux:**
>```Shell
>/var/lib/docker/volumes/
>```
> &#10240;

#### Create a log index pattern:

For logs, create the pattern `webapi-*`. This connects all app logs from different environments.

**NOTE:** You can define your own pattern, however you want to combine the data...

![Index pattern](./Assets/setup_index_pattern.PNG "Index pattern")

**NOTE:** It is required that the application runs with logging and tracking settings. This will automatically generate index patterns and send some data to Elastic. Without data, it is not possible to set up index patterns in Kibana!

You should see these patterns in the recommendation list:

- `apm-*` (`apm-7.14.0-error`, `apm-7.14.0-metric` etc...)
- `webapi-*` (`webapi-development` or `api-production` or webapi-anything...)

The `apm` indexes are created by the APM server. The `webapi-*` indexes are created by the logging exporter (*Serilog ElasticSink*) and depend on our logging setup, where you can find this line:

```c#
//Application logs are indexed by enviroment (`api-development` or `api-production` ... ).
IndexFormat = $"{Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetName().Name.ToLower().Replace(".", "-")}-{environment?.ToLower().Replace(".", "-")}-{DateTime.UtcNow:yyyy-MM}",
```

The next step is to select a primary index field. Usually you want to filter and sort by `@timestamp`.

![Log Primary field](./Assets/primary_field.PNG "Log Primary field")

As you can see in the last screen, the elastic is `parsed > normalised > recoginze fields types` and provides information about search and aggregation field options.

![IndexContent](./Assets/elastic_index_parsing_and_normalization.PNG "IndexContent")

If you now navigate to the discover page again, you should be able to see the latest logs sent by the application.

![Logs Overview](./Assets/logs_overview.PNG "Logs Overview")

##### Logs structure

Each log may contain different data, but the main header is always the same. The contents of the 'fields` may change. This is an example of a log showing the hit of a concrete API endpoint:

```json
{
  "_index": "webapi-development-2021-08",
  "_type": "_doc",
  "_id": "EZX0mHsB9UlYcIijQLV6",
  "_score": 1,
  "_source": {
    "@timestamp": "2021-08-30T23:25:47.7022963+02:00",
    "level": "Information", // Log level
    "messageTemplate": "{HostingRequestStartingLog:l}",
    "message": "Request starting HTTP/2 GET https://localhost:5001/WeatherForecast - -",
      "fields": {
        "SourceContext": "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Infrastructure",
        "MachineName": "MACBOOKPRO",
        "SpanId": "d6024110ad7ceaad",
        "TraceId": "94e07d57236fb28408ceb5ff29134b52",
        "ParentId": "d444092df9e7e2d2",
        "Environment": "Development"
        // And others
      },
  },
  "fields": {
    "fields.TraceId": ["6f3407b91b8699c43b7d1058a2e39a09"],
    "fields.ElasticApmTraceId": ["6f3407b91b8699c43b7d1058a2e39a09"],
    "fields.ParentId": ["f22ea25d52a9e3ef"],
    "fields.SpanId": ["5b2f3176a1cd6c78" ],
    "fields.RequestId": ["0HMBBVIO258NG:00000013"],
    "fields.Environment": ["Development"],
    "fields.MachineName": ["MACBOOKPRO"],
    "fields.ElasticApmTransactionId": ["5b2f3176a1cd6c78"],
    // And others
  }
}
```

### APM Services

The APM server knows the list of available services from the traces data already collected: (`APM Services Menu`)

![APM Services View](./Assets/APM_services_view.PNG "APM Services View")

Service Detail provides various calculated statistics on trace data. (`APM Services WebAPI Menu`)

![APM Services Detail](./Assets/APM_Service_detail.PNG "APM Services Detail")

It also provides basic *metrics* for an application service. These are generated with the APM agent and exported (from the backend .net application)

```c# 
// program.cs 
app.UseElasticApm(configuration, new IDiagnosticsSubscriber [0]);
```

This includes APM middleware that exports basic service metrics under the hood. This agent is not used to export traces. Therefore, `new IDiagnosticsSubscriber [0]` means *"Do not register listeners "*. Traces are fully managed by the `opentelemry` SDK.

#### Connect traces and logs (**Trace vs. Logs**)

If you are working with distributed logging and distributed tracing. You need to be able to quickly search and lookup to determine what a problem is and where in the request it is.

- **Distributed tracing** can be visualised as a graph. You know where in the request the problem occurred, but you do not have comprehensive information because the traces are short and serve a different purpose.
- **Logs** have detailed information about the problem, but you do not always know which part of the request failed and which succeeded. Was the request aborted because a previous process failed, or did something happen within the request?

In production, there are too many logs to keep track of the root cause of the problem. To tie *tacing* and *logging* together, we have added some special fields to the logs to tie them together.

```
"@timestamp": "2021-08-02T12:15:31.1331494+02:00",
"level": "Information",
"SpanId": "a6478f899e2ffad9",
"TraceId": "c6888a1056d03b4e66cd79676e624f25",
"ParentId": "0000000000000000",
```

`@timestamp` - When the log was captured by the application
`level` - Log level
`SpanId` - Trace identifier for easier searching of logs from distributed tracing graphs (opentelemetry).
`TraceId` - Context trace ID
`ParentId` - Parrent SpanId - Associated Span Parrent. This makes more sense if you read more about opentelemetry.

This was done in [logger configuration](./Logging.md#L74).

```c#
logCfg = logCfg
    .Enrich.FromLogContext()
    .Enrich.WithExceptionDetails()
    .Enrich.WithMachineName()
    .Enrich.WithSpan() <-- This include Span and ParrentId in logs
```

**So what is the common process for determining the problem?**
1) First, we look in Tracing Graph to see where the problem lies. We collect the `SpanIds` and `TraceId` that we are interested in.
2) We use these `Ids` to filter and look for contextual logs about these `Ids` to get more details about what really happened.

> &#10240;
> **NOTE:** With Elastic APM, this pairing is done automatically and you can view corresponding logs in the trace view.
> &#10240;

Under `Elastic > APM > Logs` you need to configure the source index of the logs. (**Change Source Configuration**)

![APM logs source](./Assets/define_apm_logs_sources.PNG "APM logs source")

This will take you to the setup page where we select **Use Kibana index pattern**.

![APM log source](./Assets/use_kibana_index_patterns.PNG "APM log source")

Then select from existing indexes:

![APM index pattern setup](./Assets/apm_index_pattern_setup.PNG "APM index pattern setup")

After this configuration, you can connect traces and logs and see them side by side.

**Trace timeline:**

![Trace view](./Assets/APM_trace_timeline.PNG "Trace view")

**Trace logs:**

![Trace view](./Assets/APM_trace_logs.PNG "Trace view")


>**NOTE:** To combine all logs indexes (sources) into one, you must combine them into an `index pattern`. You can do this at `Stack Management indexpattern`.

**Example summary pattern:** `logs-apm*,apm-*,filebeat-*,webapi-*`

(*Filebeat* etc. is configured below in the text).

</br>

### What is Logstash?

Logstash is a server-side data processing pipeline that collects data from a variety of sources simultaneously, parses it, transforms it, and then sends it to the Elastic

#### Configure Logstash index

Since `docker-compose.yml` contains the container **Logstash**, we need to add a new *index pattern* in Kibana UI to examine Logstash logs at *Discover View*.

Under `Stack Managment > Index patterns`

![Kibana add index pattern](./Assets/kibana_add_index_pattern.png "Kibana add index pattern")

Creates `logstash-*` pattern

![Add Logstash index pattern](./Assets/create_logstash_index_patten.png "Add Logstash index pattern")

Now in *Discover* view you can switch between index patterns. Since no logs was sended over *Logstash* the empty result can be returned.

![Discover change index pattern](./Assets/elastic_discover_index_pattern_select.png "Discover change index pattern")

By our `docker-compose.yaml` and `logstash.conf` we defined to listen on `tcp`, `udp` and `http`.

#### logstash.conf
```shell
input {
	tcp {
		port => 5500
	}
	udp {
		port => 5500
	}
	http {
		host => "127.0.0.1" # default: 0.0.0.0
		port => 5501 # default: 8080
	}
}

# place for filters

output {
	elasticsearch {
		hosts => "elasticsearch01:9200"
	}
}

```

> &#10240;
> **NOTE :** You can listen to multiple inputs. The inputs are available as logstash plugins. For a complete list, see [offical elastic DOCS](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/input-plugins.html).
We can send demo data with
>  &#10240;

You can test sending data to `logstash` with [PacketSender](https://packetsender.com/) to test `tcp` and `udp`. Or you can install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or use simple `curl` to test `http` input.

**PacketSender**

![Packetsender logstash test message](./Assets/packetsender_test_message_to_logstash.png "Packetsender logstash test message")

**Postman**

![Postman logstash test message](./Assets/postman_send_http_logstash_log.png "Postman logstash test message")

**Data from elastic dicover for `logstash`**

![Kibana logstash data discover view](./Assets/logstash_test_data_discover.png "Kibana logstash data discover view")

You can update the `logstash` configuration to inject the source processing defined in the 'filter' part.

You can see all available filter plugins [under the official documents](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/filter-plugins.html).

#### Logstash pipeline (filters)

##### Mutate

Performs mutations on fields

```json
# Remove some field

filter {
    mutate {
        remove_field => ["headers"]
    }
}
```

```json
# Add custom field

filter {
  mutate {
     add_field => { "show" => "This data will be in the output" } 
  }
}
```

```json
# Rename field

filter {
  mutate {
      rename => {"shortHostname" => "hostname"}
  }
}

```

Some mutate operation:

`coerce` – this sets the default value of an existing field but is null
`rename` – rename a field in the event
`replace` – replace the field with the new value
`update` – update an existing field with new value
`convert` – convert the field value to another data type
`uppercase` – this converts a string field to its uppercase equivalent
`capitalize` – this converts a string field to its capitalized equivalent
`lowercase` – convert a string field to its lowercase equivalent
`strip` – remove the leading and trailing white spaces
`remove` - removes field
`split` – This splits an array using a separating character, like a comma
`join` – This will join together an array with a separating character like a comma

You can find more info for all suported mutate operations udned [official docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-mutate.html).

##### Date

Parses dates from fields to use as the Logstash timestamp for an event

```json
# Filter specific field and format

filter {
    date {
      match => [ "timestamp" , "dd/MMM/yyyy:HH:mm:ss Z" ]
  }
}
```

##### Conditional rules 
```json
# Conditionsal expression example (format)

if EXPRESSION {
  ...
} else if EXPRESSION {
  ...
} else {
  ...
}
```

You can use the following relational operators:

*Equality:* `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
*Regexp:* `=~`, `!~` (pattern on the right against a string value on the left)
*Inclusion:* `in`, `not in`
*Boolean operators:* `and`, `or`, `nand`, `xor`
*Unary operators:* `!`

```json
# Conditional filter mutate example

filter {
  if [action] == "login" {
    mutate { remove_field => "secret" }
  }
}
```

```json
# Conditional filter example

if [type] == "nginx" {
  filter {
    mutate {
      coerce => { "service_name" => "nginx" }
      add_field => {
          "logtype" => "nginx"
          "service_name" => "myservicename"
          "hostname" => "%{host}"
        }
    }
  }
}

```

```json
# Conditional filter example

filter {
  if "_sometag_" not in [tags] {
    mutate {
      replace => { "type" => "somelog_A" }
    }
  }
  ...
  if "syslog_A" in [tags] {
    mutate {
      replace => { "type" => "somelog_B" }
    }
  }
}
```

```json
# Conditional filter example

filter {
  if [foo] in [foobar] {
    mutate { add_tag => "field in field" }
  }
  if [foo] in "foo" {
    mutate { add_tag => "field in string" }
  }
  if "hello" in [greeting] {
    mutate { add_tag => "string in field" }
  }
  if [foo] in ["hello", "world", "foo"] {
    mutate { add_tag => "field in list" }
  }
  if [missing] in [alsomissing] {
    mutate { add_tag => "shouldnotexist" }
  }
  if !("foo" in ["hello", "world"]) {
    mutate { add_tag => "shouldexist" }
  }
}
```

## Beats

Beats are single-purpose data senders. They work as agents on your servers and send operational data to Elasticsearch.

For more information, see [Official Documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/current/beats-reference.html).

There are also many open source [comunity beats available](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/current/community-beats.html).

![Elastic Beats scheme](./Assets/elastic_beats.png "Elastic Beats scheme")

This demo uses:
 - `Filebeat` - Used to send external logs to the system.
 - `Heartbeat` - Monitors services for availability with active probing
 - `Metricbeat` - Collects metrics from your systems and services
 - `Packetbeat` - Monitoring your network traffic is critical to the observability and security of your environment.
### Beats docker install

Beats as agents can be installed: - Properly on the system - As a Docker container

In this demo, `Beats` is set up as a separate Docker container group. It is important to understand that 'Beats' monitors other containers from the outside. (Host Network).

#### Compose Docker

The `./Src/Docker/Elastic/Beats` folder contains the global compose file for all beats. The folder also contains separate config files for each beat.

**`docker-compose.yml`**
<pre style="max-height: 400px; overflow-y:scroll !important">
<code>

1) Create/Copy `docker-compose.yml` [../Src/Docker/ElasticSearch/Beats/docker-compose.yml](../Src/Docker/ElasticSearch/Beats/docker-compose.yml).

2) Run `docker-compose up`. This will create, (re)create, start and attach containers for a service.

    *Output:*
    ```shell
    Creating packetbeat ... done
    Creating filebeat   ... done
    Creating metricbeat ... done
    Creating heartbeat  ... done

This will take some time to complete. If a container fails, it will try to start itself in a loop.

#### Explore containers
There should be 4 running containers available under your docker. You can use docker UI or the terminal `docker ps` to see all running containers. Use `docker ps -a` to see all containers (running/non-running).

![Beats docker containers](./Assets/beats_docker_containers.png "Beats docker containers")

Or from terminal: (`docker ps`)

```shell
# Docker Id is always different
59a056442b16   docker.elastic.co/beats/metricbeat:7.14.0              "/usr/bin/tini -- /u…"   4 minutes ago   Up 3 minutes                                                                                           metricbeat

You can see the status of the container and how long it has left to run. To start a container, you can use the following `docker start container_name`

 
### Metricbeat

`Metricbeat` is a metrics shipper that acts as an agent (installed on the machine) to collect and send various system and service metrics, preprocess them and forward the supported outputs.

**Metrics example:** `CPU usage`, `Memory usage`, `System Uptime` etc.. 

The behaviour of `Metricbeat` is defined by its configuration file. The entire file used is available at `Src/Docker/Elasticsearch/Beats/metricbeat-config.yml`.

In this scenario, `Metricbeat` collects logs from all the containers and sends this data directly to Elastic. This helps us to shop all the logs associated with the containers in the Elastic engine.

> &#10240;
> **NOTE:** Metrics are also sent from the client application via the `Opentelemetry` log and the `APM` agent. This all together creates one source for all observational data and allows us to easily visualise it with Kibana dashboards.

#### Heartbeat

`Heartbeat` is a health shipper that is used as an agent (installed on the machine) and monitors the uptime of services by pinging or calling them and forwarding the results to one of the supported outputs.

The behaviour of `Heartbeat` is defined by its configuration file. The full file can be found at `Src/Docker/Elasticsearch/Beats/heartbeat-config.yml`.

In this scenario, `Heartbeat` periodically collects the services data via `tcp` and `http` calls.

**From `heartbeat-config.yml`:**

```yml
- type: tcp
  name: Elasticsearch-TCP
  schedule: '@every 5s'
